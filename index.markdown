# Workshop at ALife XV

## Organizers: [Emily Dolson](http://www.EmilyLDolson.com) and [Charles Ofria](https://www.ofria.com)

Often, research done by scientists in one field can take a long time to percolate to scientists in another field. This is especially true in Biology and Computer Science, even with closely related sub-fields such as evolutionary computation and evolutionary biology. Such delays can substantially slow down scientific discovery, leading to the premium that many funding agencies have placed on research that cuts across disciplines. The field of Artificial Life is populated by such interdisciplinary scientists, who are well-positioned to improve this situation by surveying research from the constituent communities and synthesizing it into a coherent whole, including evolutionary biology, ecology, animal behavior, molecular biology, evolutionary computation, robotics, philosophy, and many other areas of biology and computer science.

The goal of this workshop is to bring about such syntheses by organizing attendees into longer-term working groups to write cross-disciplinary reviews on subjects related to Artificial Life. To this end, we will be accepting 5-10 proposals for this workshop. Each proposal should summarize a topic for a cross-disciplinary review paper relevant to Artificial Life, including a description of which fields/bodies of research the review would draw upon. Authors of accepted proposals will give a 10-15 minute talk about their proposed topic during the first half of the workshop. After the talks, interested attendees will break into working groups to begin planning out review papers for each topic. Because the goal of these papers is to bring together a wide range of ideas and experience, large working groups in which everyone contributes a small piece to the paper are encouraged, and working groups will be encouraged to invite additional contributions to their reviews from beyond the Artificial Life community.

At the end of the workshop, we will reconvene to discuss overarching ideas and plan logistics for writing the review series. We will also set up organizational structure and a target timeline to facilitate completion of the reviews after the conference.
