Sick of constantly having to write background sections that summarize the same intersection of literature? Wish there was a review paper that you could cite to explain to people from all fields how the research fits together? Now's your chance to make it happen! Proposals should be approximately ~1 page, and address the following questions:

  * What topics will the review address?
  * Which subfields will the review bring together?
  * How will synthesizing these bodies of research benefit the field(s)?

**Expectations of accepted proposals:** By submitting a proposal to this workshop, you are proposing both to give a ~10-15 minute talk on your proposed topic, and to take the lead on organizing the resulting review paper. It is reccomended that you plan on bringing a rough outline of the review with you to the workshop as jumping off point for further discussion.

**What we'll provide:**

  * A forum to present your ideas, find collaborators, and get started on your review
  * Organization/structure after the conference for keeping all of the reviews moving forward to completion
